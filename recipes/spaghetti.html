    <h2 class="description">Description</h2>

    <p>This cherry tomato pasta recipe is perfect for a weeknight dinner—especially when time is short or it's too hot to stand over a stove for long. While it highlights summer flavors, this easy pasta dish is actually wonderful all year long. Good cherry and grape tomatoes are available year-round thanks to the fact that they ripen in less time than larger tomatoes and are also easy to grow in hothouses (and in warmer climates) in the winter. This recipe takes full advantage of their juicy sweetness and acidic pop. </p>
